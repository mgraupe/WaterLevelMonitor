# Terrace Weather Station

Temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, luminosity are measures through different sensors (DS18B20, TSL2591 and BME280).

The water level of the water butt is read automatically through an ultrasonic distance sensor (JSN-SR04T-2.0). 

Rainfall data (from weather station [Paris 6ème - Saint Germain des Prés](https://www.infoclimat.fr/observations-meteo/temps-reel/paris-6eme-saint-germain-des-pres/000CT.html)) and water collected in water butt compared.
